## üíº Professional Experience

### GEP Solutions Worldwide (June 2022 - April 2023)
**Senior Software Engineer**
    
As a Senior Software Engineer, I have consistently delivered high-quality, defect-free projects on time by leveraging rigorous testing, continuous integration, and deployment practices. My expertise in UI development with Angular and React.js is focused on creating responsive designs and enhancing user accessibility, which has significantly improved user interaction and satisfaction.

In a leadership role, I successfully designed, coded, and deployed a critical financial application for BoFA, ensuring compliance with stringent security and data protection standards. I executed complex SQL and graph database operations for optimal data retrieval and integrity and streamlined application tiers, facilitating data migration to modern platforms with robust API integration and error logging using .NET and C#.

By adopting a microservices architecture, I enhanced system performance, reduced code duplication, and improved repository communication. I collaborated closely with business analysts and architects to develop new platform features and functionality, implementing clean coding practices and using iTextSharp for efficient PDF document management. Utilizing asynchronous methods and tasks, I ensured real-time updates and expedited data migration, significantly boosting application performance and user experience.

My exceptional debugging skills have enabled me to quickly resolve issues and implement hotfixes, enhancing system reliability. I have mentored junior developers, contributed to code reviews, and promoted best practices and operational excellence. I advanced UI stability in legacy systems by addressing login challenges with Razor Pages, and improved single-page application performance through Angular's dynamic features.

Additionally, I implemented reusable components and hooks in React, optimized application performance with lazy loading, code splitting, and memoization techniques, and adhered to SOLID principles to ensure API dependability and superior code quality. By implementing advanced automated testing frameworks using Jest, I conducted thorough unit tests, enhancing the reliability and performance of financial applications.

My innovative approach to user-centric experiences prioritizes self-service capabilities and leverages low-code development to enhance overall application usability and efficiency.


### Accenture Private Limited (June 2019 - June 2022)
**Senior Software Engineer**
 
In my role as a Senior Software Engineer, I have ensured a seamless and inclusive user experience across various devices by leveraging CSS media queries, Bootstrap, and aria-attributes. I implemented Azure Web Jobs and Function Apps to run at regular intervals, fetching details from the Microsoft CRM application, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and implement responsive, mobile-first user interfaces using React and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.

I developed stored procedures and implemented caching at both the session and API levels, enhancing operational effectiveness and user interaction by leveraging ASP.NET‚Äôs asynchronous features and CRM for data retrieval. I improved data retrieval efficiency and safeguarded sensitive information by employing Angular's forkJoin for performance optimization and implementing role-based access control in search features.

Utilizing multithreading and the Task Parallel Library (TPL), I achieved real-time synchronization with the upstream system, significantly enhancing application performance for users handling a large number of requests. My strategic data synchronization methods significantly reduced user wait times. I enabled versatile data export options (Excel, PDF, PPT) using Angular Packages for each format with direct email functionality, and utilized Jasmine to develop and execute integration tests, ensuring seamless interaction between components and services.

I implemented Angular for effective server-side communication and error handling, and integrated Azure Service Bus and Web Jobs to facilitate timely notifications and automate tasks. Maintaining minimal downtime through diligent on-call support and rapid problem-solving was a key aspect of my role. Additionally, I guided new team members, led client demos, and ensured deliverables' production readiness through thorough testing and security audits.
